# PrintheadClassification
I created these two programs for the company I currently work at. 
We have printehads that go baad over time and we needed an objective way of classifying printheads. 
I created two programs to accomplish this goal. Full project report can be found [here](https://1drv.ms/b/c/0e2e2a1633c750ee/EUqn8s7qZ6BDtImhZYJara8BUvRMtaRHv0YVkcOXtVc_dQ?e=fRIeJR)

# PrintheadClassification
I created these two programs for the company I currently work at. 
We have printheads that go bad over time and we needed an objective way of classifying printheads according to their current level of quality. 
I created two programs to accomplish this goal. The full project report can be found [here](file:///C:/Users/livfr/OneDrive/Desktop/Job%20Search%20Materials/printhead%20project/Printhead%20Classification%20Software%20Project%20Report.pdf)
